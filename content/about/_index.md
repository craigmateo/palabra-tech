I’m a technical professional with over 15 years of experience in non-profit and software organizations.

Over the past decade, I’ve worked across three startups in **e-commerce, edtech, and machine learning**, as well as at **Microsoft and Intel**, gaining experience in documentation, training, web development, and data visualization.

As a freelance consultant under **Palabra Technical** (2014–present), I handle **full-stack development, programming, web copy, technical writing, and project management**, delivering projects end-to-end with planning, budgeting, and high-quality execution.

Previously, I worked with various non-profits and international development organizations (2007–2014), managing projects across multiple countries.

### At the Interface of Computation, Visualization, and Technical Storytelling

A common observation throughout my career has been **siloed skill sets and workflows**. Many organizations needed not only technical solutions but also **integration and holistic thinking** that creates clarity for customers and users.

I focus on bridging these gaps — combining **technical expertise, communication, and structured storytelling** to deliver solutions that are not only functional but also clear, usable, and impactful.
